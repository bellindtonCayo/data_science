# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview ](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj)
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MSE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier)
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
